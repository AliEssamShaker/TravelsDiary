# TravelsDiary

Hi there, 

Welcome to this amazing django web app for travel enthusaists that I worked on over the christmas break. I truly enjoyed this experience and the learning journey. 
This project is'nt fully 'complete' as I am planning on adding a lot more features and functionalities soon. 

Please note that over here in github the files hierarchy is not correct as github did not allow me to drag and drop whole folders that has any empty files, but 
you should still be able to look at all the code and files that matter and demonstrate my work. I will be deploying this web app on heroku soon, so stay tuned for using it.
